But instructions say one top-level object, no nested ifs.\n\nTherefore, we create a routine with a \"conditions\" array and \"actions\" array, each with a \"trigger\" and corresponding \"action\".\n\nBut instructions specify one top-level object with conditions and actions expressed as plain JSON key/values, no nested if blocks. So we will create a routine with a \"condition\" that is an OR of two conditions, and an \"action\" that uses a \"switch\" on which condition was true.\n\nSince JSONLogic does not support switch, we can use \"if\" with \"==\" checks inside the action to decide which command to send.\n\nHowever, the instructions say no nested if blocks, so we must create two separate routines instead.\n\nGiven that, we will create two separate routines:\n\nRoutine 1: Name \"Turn on Den Night Light slowly when Christmas Tree Kitchen physically turned on\"\nRoutine 2: Name \"Turn off Den Night Light immediately when Office Pole Lamp turned off\"\n\nThis satisfies the user query fully and respects instructions.\n\n---\n\n**Routine 1:**\n- Condition: Christmas Tree Kitchen sends DFON command\n- Action: Set Den Night Light Ramp Rate to 5 minutes (enum 4), then turn on Den Night Light to 50%\n\n**Routine 2:**\n- Condition: Office Pole Lamp Status changes to 0 (off)\n- Action: Turn off Den Night Light immediately\n\n---\n\nNow we produce the JSON for both routines in one output as separate JSON objects (5 examples requested, so we will produce 5 diverse examples below)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"automation": {"name": "Turn on Den Night Light slowly when Christmas Tree Kitchen physically turned on", "condition": {"==": {"device": "Christmas Tree Kitchen", "coc": "DFON"}}, "actions": [{"device": "Den Night Light", "command": "Ramp Rate", "parameters": [{"name": "RR", "value": 4, "uom": "enum", "precision": 0}]}, {"device": "Den Night Light", "command": "On", "parameters": [{"name": "level", "value": 50, "uom": "percent", "precision": 1}]}]}}}]}
