The primary command to turn it on is the \"On\" command (DON), which accepts an optional parameter for brightness level ranging from 0 to 100 percent. Additionally, you can use \"Fast On\" (DFON) for quick activation, also accepting a brightness parameter from 0 to 100 percent. Other related commands include \"Brighten\" (BRT), \"Fade Up\" (FDUP), and \"On Level\" (OL) which also accept brightness levels within the same range. The \"Ramp Rate\" (RR) command can be used to set the transition speed with predefined enum values ranging from 9.0 minutes down to 0.1 seconds. Therefore, to turn on the Kitchen Can Lights, you can use the On command with a brightness parameter between 0 and 100 percent, optionally specifying a ramp rate for the fade-in effect."}]}
