It is an open-source platform developed by Universal Devices and contributed to the NuCore.ai Foundation. NuCore enables powerful integration and automation for smart homes and buildings using a **Typeless** Architecture. This means that devices do not need to conform to a fixed type like Thermostat, HVAC, or Sensor, allowing more flexibility in automation and AI integration."}]}
