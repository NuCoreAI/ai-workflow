ceiling light to gradually brighten to 80% over 3 minutes when turned on, and turn off immediately when switched off."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To fulfill this request, we must use the kitchen ceiling light's properties and commands to create a CPN that models the gradual brightening and immediate off behavior.\n\nReasoning:\n- The device supports an On Level property from 0 to 100% and a Ramp Rate enum with values including 3.0 minutes (index 8).\n- To brighten gradually to 80%, we will set the On Level to 80 and Ramp Rate to 3.0 minutes.\n- When turning on, the transition will send commands to set Ramp Rate to 3.0 minutes and then On Level to 80%.\n- When turning off, the device should turn off immediately, so we use the Fast Off command.\n\nCPN Structure:\n- Places:\n  - \"Light_Off\" with token indicating the light is off.\n  - \"Light_On\" with token indicating the light is on at a certain brightness.\n  - \"Command_Queue\" to hold commands to send.\n- Transitions:\n  - \"Turn_On\": fires when light is off and receives an on request.\n    - Actions: Set Ramp Rate to 3.0 minutes, then set On Level to 80%.\n  - \"Turn_Off\": fires when light is on and receives an off request.\n    - Actions: Send Fast Off command.\n\nTokens:\n- Tokens carry the current status (Off or On with brightness).\n- Commands carry parameters for Ramp Rate and On Level.\n\nFinal CPN (flattened):\n\nPlaces:\n- Light_Off: holds token \"Off\"\n- Light_On: holds token \"On(80)\"\n- Command_Queue: holds commands to send\n\nTransitions:\n- Turn_On:\n  Input:
